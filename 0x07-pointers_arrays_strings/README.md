0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
Welcome to my low level C programming experience at ALX. In this project we will be using pointers, arrays and strings to complete different tasks.

Goals
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
